			"bio": [
				"Andrei Pancu's practice is a material exploration of the profound dialogue between chaos and control. Born in Bucharest, Romania in 1968 and now working in Ottawa, Canada, Pancu creates layered compositions through the masterful manipulation of patinas on ferrous metals. The work synthesizes ambiguous motifs that are at once natural and man-made, embodying a dynamic equilibrium, a state of figures and events suspended in time. The tone is consistently subdued, serene, and contemplative, with a palette of deep browns, ochres, and muted reds that arise organically from the material itself. Pancu crafts his own frames from mild steel to support his free-standing and wall-mounted pieces. While a protective wax is applied to seal the patina, some oxidative processes continue, ultimately consuming the work. In light of this, Pancu photographs the progression of the patina, capturing ephemeral states from which he creates limited-edition giclée prints.",

				"The interaction of a free-flowing, disorderly system with an ordered, external force is both the subject and the process of Pancu's work. In his series, 'Strange Attractors', order is represented by the artist's conscious, willful intent as he applies stamps and masks to temper the chaotic flow of the evolving patina. The desperate impulse to maintain order against a relentless entropic force is a metaphor for the human condition. Pancu pits these opposing forces against each other, placing them into a dialectical play that embodies the thesis and antithesis of Hegel's concept of development through contradiction. Pancu engages the viewer with intricate stamps of incomplete, ambiguous signifiers, designed to activate their subconscious to give meaning to the missing references.",
